		<h3>ESSPRESSO</h3>

		<p>Espresso (/ɛˈsprɛsoʊ/, Italian: [esˈprɛsso]) is coffee brewed by forcing a small amount of nearly boiling water under pressure through finely ground coffee beans. Espresso is generally thicker than coffee brewed by other methods, has a higher concentration of suspended and dissolved solids, and has crema on top (a foam with a creamy consistency).[1] As a result of the pressurized brewing process, the flavors and chemicals in a typical cup of espresso are very concentrated. Espresso is also the base for other drinks such as a caffè latte, cappuccino, caffè macchiato, cafe mocha, or caffè Americano. Espresso has more caffeine per unit volume than most coffee beverages, but because the usual serving size is much smaller, the total caffeine content is less than a mug of standard brewed coffee, contrary to a common belief.[2] Although the actual caffeine content of any coffee drink varies by size, bean origin, roast method and other factors, the caffeine content of "typical" servings of espresso vs. drip brew are 120 to 170 mg[3] vs. 150 to 200 mg.[4][5]</p>

		<h3>INSTANT COFFEE
		</h3>
		<a href="http://www.perfectdailygrind.com/2015/01/why-you-shouldnt-drink-instantand-why-i-hate-it/"><img src="http://static4.depositphotos.com/1000998/364/i/950/depositphotos_3643735-Cap-instant-coffee.jpg"></a>
		<p>Instant coffee, also called soluble coffee, coffee crystals and coffee powder, is a beverage derived from brewed coffee beans. Instant coffee is commercially prepared by either freeze-drying or spray drying, after which it can be rehydrated. Instant coffee in a concentrated liquid form is also manufactured.[1]
<br/><br/>
Advantages of instant coffee include speed of preparation (instant coffee dissolves instantly in hot water), lower shipping weight and volume than beans or ground coffee (to prepare the same amount of beverage), and long shelf life — though instant coffee can spoil if not kept dry</p>

		<h3>TURKISH COFFEE
		</h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_coffee" target="_blank">

		<p>Turkish coffee (Turkish: Türk kahvesi, or Armenian coffee, or Arabic coffee, or Greek coffee, or Cypriot coffee) is a method of preparing unfiltered coffee.[1][2] Roasted and then finely ground coffee beans are boiled in a pot (cezve), usually with sugar, and served in a cup where the grounds are allowed to settle. At present, it is found in the Middle East, North Africa, the Caucasus, the Balkans, Bali, and Eastern Europe.

Turkish Coffee is an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Turkey confirmed by UNESCO.[3]</p></div>
